        <h1>Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</h1>
        <section class="maintopic">
            <p><b>Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</b> (Urdu/Punjabi: نصرت فتح علی خان), born <b>Anjum Pervaiz Ali Khan</b> (13
                October 1948 – 16
                August 1997), was a Pakistani vocalist and musician, primarily a singer of Qawwali, a form of Sufi
                Islamic devotional music. Widely considered one of the greatest voices ever recorded, he possessed
                an extraordinary range of vocal abilities and could perform at a high level of intensity for several
                hours. Extending the 600-year old Qawwali tradition of his family, Khan is widely credited
                with introducing Qawwali music to international audiences. He is popularly known as
                "Shahenshah-e-Qawwali", meaning "The Emperor of Qawwali". <br>
                <br>

                Born in Faisalabad, Khan had his first public performance at the age of 16, at his father's chelum. He
                became the head of the family qawwali party in 1971. He was signed by Oriental Star Agencies,
                Birmingham, England in the early 1980s. Khan went on to release movie scores and albums in Europe,
                India, Japan, Pakistan and the U.S. He engaged in collaborations and experiments with Western artists,
                becoming a well-known world music artist. He toured extensively, performing in over 40 countries. In
                addition to popularising Qawwali music, he also had a big impact on contemporary South Asian popular
                music, including Pakistani pop, Indi-pop and Bollywood music.</p><br>

                <h3>Early Life And Career</h3>
                <p>
                    Khan was born in a Punjabi Muslim family in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948, shortly
                    after the partition of India in 1947 during which his family had migrated to Pakistan from their
                    native city of Jalandhar in Punjab, British India (now in Punjab, India). His family originates from
                    Basti Sheikh in Jalandhar. His ancestors learned music and singing there and adopted it as a
                    profession. He was the fifth child and first son of Fateh Ali Khan, a musicologist, vocalist,
                    instrumentalist, and qawwal. Khan's family, which included four older sisters and a younger brother,
                    Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan, grew up in central Faisalabad. The tradition of qawwali in the family had
                    passed down through successive generations for almost 600 years. Initially, his father did not
                    want Khan to follow the family's vocation. He had his heart set on Nusrat choosing a much more
                    respectable career path and becoming a doctor or engineer because he felt Qawwali artists had low
                    social status. However, Khan showed such an aptitude for and interest in Qawwali, that his father
                    finally relented. He began by learning the tabla before moving on to vocals.[citation needed] In
                    1964, Khan's father died, leaving his musical education under the supervision of his paternal
                    uncles, Mubarak Ali Khan and Salamat Ali Khan. He is the uncle of singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.
                    Nusrat was known as Pervaiz until he visited Ghulam Ghaus Samdani who changed his name to Nusrat
                    Fateh Ali. Samdani also told him that he would become a great singer.

                    In 1971, after the death of his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan, Khan became the official leader of the
                    family Qawwali party and the party became known as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mujahid Mubarak Ali Khan &
                    Party. Khan's first public performance as the leader of the Qawwali party was at a studio recording
                    broadcast as part of an annual music festival organized by Radio Pakistan, known as Jashn-e-Baharan.
                    Khan sang mainly in Urdu and Punjabi and occasionally in Persian, Braj Bhasha and Hindi. His first
                    major hit in Pakistan was the song Haq Ali Ali, which was performed in a traditional style and with
                    traditional instrumentation. The song featured restrained use of Khan's sargam improvisations.
                    <h3>Later Career</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the summer of 1985, Khan performed at the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in
                        London. He performed in Paris in 1985 and 1988. He first visited Japan in 1987, at the
                        invitation of the Japan Foundation. He performed at the 5th Asian Traditional Performing Art
                        Festival in Japan. He also performed at Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York in 1989, earning
                        him admiration from the American audience.<br><br>

                        Khan, throughout his career, had great understanding with many south Asian singers such as Alam
                        Lohar, the Noor Jehan, and various other Pakistani and Indian singers.<br> <br>

                        In the 1992 to 1993 academic year, Khan was a Visiting Artist in the Ethnomusicology department
                        at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States. <br> <br>

                        In 1988, Khan teamed up with Peter Gabriel on the soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ,
                        which led to Khan being signed to Gabriel's Real World label. He would go on to release five
                        albums of traditional Qawwali through Real World, along with the more experimental albums Mustt
                        Mustt (1990), Night Song (1996), and the posthumous remix album Star Rise (1997). <br> <br>

                        Khan's experimental work for Real World, which featured his collaborations with the Canadian
                        guitarist Michael Brook, spurred on several further collaborations with a number of other
                        Western composers and rock musicians. One of the most noteworthy of these collaborations came in
                        1995, when Khan grouped with Pearl Jam's lead singer Eddie Vedder on two songs for the
                        soundtrack to Dead Man Walking. Khan also provided vocals for The Prayer Cycle, which was put
                        together by Jonathan Elias, but died before the tracks could be completed. Alanis Morissette was
                        brought in to sing with his unfinished vocals. In 2002, Gabriel included Khan's vocals on the
                        posthumously released track "Signal to Noise" on his album Up. <br> <br>

                        Khan's album Intoxicated Spirit was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album
                        in 1997. That same year, his album Night Song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best
                        World Music Album. <br> <br>

                        Khan contributed songs to, and performed in, several Pakistani films. Shortly before his death,
                        he composed music for three Bollywood films, which includes the film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, in which
                        he also sang for "Koi Jaane Koi Na Jaane" on-screen with the lead pair, and "Zindagi Jhoom Kar".
                        He also composed music for Kartoos, where he sang for "Ishq Da Rutba", and "Bahaa Na Aansoo",
                        alongside Udit Narayan. He died very shortly prior to the movie's release. His final music
                        composition for Bollywood was for the movie, Kachche Dhaage, where he sang in "Iss Shaan-E-Karam
                        Ka Kya Kehna". The movie was released in 1999, two years after his death. The two singing
                        sisters of Bollywood, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar sang for the songs he composed in his
                        brief stint in Bollywood. He also sang "Saya Bhi Saath Jab Chhod Jaye" for Sunny Deol's movie
                        Dillagi. The song was released in 1999, two years after Khan's death. He also sang "Dulhe Ka
                        Sehra" from the Bollywood movie Dhadkan which was released in 2000. <br><br>

                        Khan. Rahman's 2007 song "Tere Bina" for the film Guru was also composed as a tribute to Khan.

                        <h3>Death</h3>

                        <p>
                            Various reports said Khan weighed over 300 pounds. He had been seriously ill for several
                            months, according to a spokesperson at his U.S. label, American Recordings. After traveling
                            to London from his native Pakistan for treatment for liver and kidney problems, he was
                            rushed from the airport to Cromwell Hospital in London.<br><br>

                            He died of a sudden cardiac arrest at Cromwell Hospital on 16 August 1997, aged 48. His body
                            was repatriated to Faisalabad, and his funeral was a public affair. He was buried in
                            Kabootran Wala Qabristan also known as Jhang Road Graveyard on Jhang Road,
                            Faisalabad.<br><br>

                            His wife, Naheed Nusrat, died on 13 September 2013 in Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga,
                            Ontario, Canada. Naheed had moved to Canada after the death of her husband. She is survived
                            by their daughter Nida Khan.[29][30] Khan's musical legacy is now carried forward by his
                            nephews, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Rizwan-Muazzam.
